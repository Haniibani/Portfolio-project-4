### The Skeleton Plane

#### Wireframe mock-ups

Wireframes were produced for most pages, excluding those primarily containing forms, like the add product page. A comprehensive PDF with all wireframes is available [here](/static/docs/wireframes.pdf).

Detailed attention was directed towards universal elements on each page, notably the header and the footer. The header incorporates multiple layers of navigation, ensuring users can quickly access account information while being distinct from primary navigation. For mobile and tablet, a horizontal bar in the main menu differentiates these, while on desktop the account-related navigation is positioned above the main site links.

---

## The Surface Plane

### Design

Once I was happy with the overall structure of the site, and the layout of the wireframes, I selected a colour scheme based on a desire for a simple and clean aesthetic. The site incorporates two main colours, blue and white, although specific shades were selected for various different areas, they all remained within the blue family. Blue was chosen due to the fictional business base location and the county colours are blue and white. The white or off white shades are tinted with a little blue to maintain consistency. The colour scheme was referenced using the [contrast grid](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%23FFFFFF%2C%20White%0D%0A%23000000%2C%20Black%0D%0A%2303045E%2C%20Primary%0D%0A%23f2f4f8%2C%20Primary-text%0D%0A%23c7ccdb%2C%20Secondary%0D%0A%23f7c59f%2C%20Accent%0D%0A%2370ae6e%2C%20Success%0D%0A%23ef626c%2C%20Error%0D%0A%231188a0%2C%20Info%0D%0A%23f3c178%2C%20Warning) which provides a grid of colour contrasts to ensure only those which would easily pass the AAA standard were selected to maximise accessibility for users.

![Colour Contrast Grid](/static/docs/img/contrast-grid.png)

### Typography 

Three different fonts were utilised for the site. The main heading font of Orbitron and the smaller subheading font of Economica were selected for their futuristic almost technical feeling whilst Montserrat was chosen as a complimentary font which allowed users the ability to read the text easily and clearly.

#### Images

Background images were acquired from free image sites [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) and [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), product photos were found on manufacturer media pages.

## Testing

### Testing Strategy

I utilised both automated and manual testing strategies during the development of the site. For a comprehensive breakdown of the testing methodologies and procedures, refer to the [testing.md file](TESTING.md).

In addition to the functionality testing of the site and the code testing, User Story tests were conducted to ensure that the acceptance criteria of the previously listed user stories were fulfilled. The commit that addressed the functionality requirements for each user story can be found in the issues section of the repository. It was applied to every issue before it was closed and marked as completed.

#### Testing Overview

Testing was categorized into distinct sections, ensuring individual testing with developed test cases for each segment.

[View the Testing Schedule Overview](/static/docs/testing-schedule.pdf)

For an in-depth analysis of the testing procedures and methods, consult the [testing.md file](TESTING.md).

#### Validator Testing

Every code file underwent validation using the appropriate validators for their specific language. Complete details are available in the testing.md file. All code passed validation. However, some issues arose from code produced by third parties:
- Django's built-in code in the settings file led to five line length errors.
- Bootstrap code yielded 260 warnings during CSS validation.
- Fontawesome CDN resulted in 6 HTML validation errors concerning CSS variables within the CDN CSS code.

#### Automated Testing

Automated tests have been meticulously constructed for the Django-based blog application to ensure its robustness and reliability. These tests cover a spectrum of functionalities, including model integrity, view behaviors, and URL routing.

**Models Testing**:
- **Recipe Model**: Tests have been designed to verify the default ordering of recipe instances, the uniqueness of the 'slug' field, and the functionality of the `number_of_likes` method.
- **Ingredient Model**: Two sets of tests were written to ensure the correct string representation of the Ingredient model.
- **Comment Model**: Tests have been composed to verify the string representation and default ordering of comments.

**Views Testing**:
- **RecipeListView**: Verifies the URL's existence at the desired location, accessibility through its name, and the correct template usage.
- **RecipeDetailView**: Ensures the detail view URL is correctly positioned, can be accessed via its name, and uses the appropriate template.
- **RecipeLikeView**: A test confirms the functionality of the "like" feature by simulating a user liking a recipe and ensuring the proper redirection.

**URLs Testing**:
Tests have been carried out to ensure that the URLs correctly resolve for the respective views, providing a seamless navigation experience.

To run these comprehensive tests, one would need to clone the repository. It's crucial to note that the project settings have been configured to connect to the designated database if a database URL is found in the config variables. For a safe testing environment, omit the database URL in the config variables; this will prompt Django to run the tests on a SQLite3 test database, thereby safeguarding your primary PostgreSQL database (especially relevant if hosted on platforms like Heroku).

![Automated testing results](/static/docs/img/features/tests.png)

By leveraging this expansive suite of 45 tests, potential issues can be preemptively identified and addressed, underscoring a commitment to delivering a high-quality application.


#### Lighthouse Testing

Google Lighthouse was employed to obtain a holistic assessment of the website's performance. Although every test area returned a green score surpassing 90, the aggregate performance score varied based on the internet connection speed during the test. Scores ranged between 92 and 100 upon multiple test runs. The accessibility score was slightly affected due to non-sequential usage of headings across the site. The best practice score was influenced by the included JavaScript files from Mailchimp and Stripe, alongside the use of Bootstrap and jQuery libraries.

![Google Lighthouse Results](/static/docs/img/features/lighthouse.png)

## Deployment üöÄ

The Pie Central website has been developed using Gitpod, specifically from a template provided by Code Institute. The codebase for the site is hosted on GitHub, and the live site is deployed via Heroku. Below are the steps that outline the deployment process:

### Setting up in Gitpod:

1. **Starting with the Code Institute Template**:
   - The project was initialized using a Gitpod template provided by Code Institute. This template sets up an environment with some necessary tools and extensions beneficial for development.

2. **GitHub Repository Setup**:
   - Within the Gitpod workspace, a new git repository was initiated using `git init`.
   - This local repository was then linked to a corresponding GitHub repository.

3. **Regular Commits**:
   - During the development phase, regular commits were made to ensure a documented progression.
   - These commits were pushed to the GitHub repository with the `git push` command.

### Heroku Deployment:

1. **Creation of Heroku App**: 
   - A new Heroku app was established post-login.
   - The deploy tab was navigated, and the GitHub account was connected, subsequently linking the Pie Central repository.

2. **Configuring Environment Variables**: 
   - The 'Config Vars' section was accessed under the settings tab of the Heroku app.
   - Necessary environment variables were set here, ensuring sensitive information remains confidential and away from version control.

3. **Enabling Automatic Deployment**:
   - The deployment method set to GitHub can be found within the deploy tab.
   - Automatic deployment was enabled for the master branch. This configuration ensures that each time a push is made to this branch on GitHub, Heroku automatically deploys the updates.

### Local Execution:

- For the purposes of local development and testing, the project was hosted in Gitpod.
- Dependencies were managed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- The `heroku local` command enabled viewing of the app within a local environment.

By using the Gitpod template from Code Institute, integrating Gitpod with GitHub, and then connecting GitHub to Heroku, a streamlined deployment process was maintained. This structure supports efficient development, testing, and live application updates.
