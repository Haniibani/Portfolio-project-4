### The Skeleton Plane

#### Wireframe Mock-ups

Wireframes play a critical role in the initial phases of web development. They provide a visual representation of the structural layout, helping to clarify user flow and page designs before any coding begins.

For this project, wireframes were meticulously crafted for several pages, capturing the essence of the user interface while emphasizing global elements such as the header and footer. The multi-layered navigation in the header distinctly separates account information from primary site navigation, ensuring an intuitive and user-friendly experience.

Below are some of the wireframes created for the project:

- **Home Page**:
  ![Home Page Wireframe](static/Images/WireframeHome.png)

- **Sign-In Page**:
  ![Sign-In Page Wireframe](static/Images/WireframeSignIn.png)

- **Post Detail Page**:
  ![Post Detail Page Wireframe](static/Images/WireframePostdetail.png)

Though not every single page was wireframed‚Äîparticularly those dominated by forms‚Äîthe majority were planned out to ensure a cohesive design strategy.

## The Surface Plane

### Design

The foundation of the site's design began with establishing the overall structure and wireframe layout. Once the skeletal structure was defined, focus shifted towards enhancing the aesthetic through careful choice of colors and typography. Below is a detailed breakdown of the site's design:

**Colors**:
- The primary color palette leans heavily on shades of purple. Specifically, `#361a3a` is a dominant tone used for brand emphasis, while `#5c4461` and `#6a4f6f` are used to provide depth and contrast in various sections.
- An accent color of `#e84610` (a vibrant shade of red-orange) is introduced to draw attention and provide interactive feedback.
- A consistent background color of `#f9fafc` is used to maintain a clean and streamlined design. For sections requiring more emphasis or contrast, `#fff` (white) and `#445261` (dark blue-gray) are employed.
- Interactive elements often transition to a shade of `#9b6fa3` on hover, ensuring user feedback.

**Typography**:
- The website primarily uses the Lato font, known for its clarity and versatility. This ensures readability across different sections.
- A distinction in font weight, oscillating between `300` (thin) and `700` (bold), offers a balance between content hierarchy and aesthetics.

**Responsive Design**:
- Flexbox is heavily used to ensure elements are arranged logically and responsively across various viewport sizes.
- Media queries further refine the design for different device sizes, ensuring the website is mobile-friendly and provides an optimal experience across devices.

**Branding**:
- The `.brand` class and its variants are reserved for site branding. They sport the primary purple (`#361a3a`) and are strategically placed with defined font sizes and weights.

**Interactive Elements**:
- Buttons, links, and certain interactive components are designed to change color upon hover or active states, providing clear feedback to users.
- Specifically, buttons like `.btn-signup` offer a color switch between background and text on interaction, providing a pleasant yet noticeable feedback.

**Structure & Layout**:
- The design follows a flexbox model, ensuring content flows logically and adjusts appropriately across devices.
- Containers such as `.masthead` have been employed for featured content, with intricate designs like gradient overlays for depth.
- The footer is designed with a distinct dark-purple background (`#5c4461`) to differentiate it from the main content and house links/icons with white color, which transitions to a lighter purple on hover.

The design choices reflect the site's commitment to providing an engaging, user-friendly experience while aligning with the fictional business's branding based on the blue and white county colors. The meticulous design approach ensures not only a visually appealing site but also one that is functional and intuitive.

### Typography 

Three fonts were used for the site. The primary heading font, Orbitron, and the subheading font, Economica, were chosen for their futuristic, technical feel. Montserrat was selected as a complementary font to ensure clear and easy readability.

#### Images

Pie images were sourced from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/).

## Features

### Interactive Imagery

At ReciPie, visuals combine with interactivity, enhancing the experience of browsing pie recipes:

- **Title Hover Effect**: Hovering over each recipe title reveals a unique animation via the `.image-flash` design.
- **Like Counter Hover Effect**: An enticing hover effect surfaces when users hover over the like counter, achieved through the `.image-flash-likes` styling.

### Engaging Buttons

Buttons at Recipie are designed not just for functionality but also for user engagement:

- **Sign-up Button**: With the `.btn-signup` class, this button invites users to join the Recipie community. Its hover effect hints at the baking adventures awaiting new members.
- **Like Button**: The `.btn-like` button lets users express admiration for a recipe. The hover effect ensures each interaction feels personalized.

## Testing

### Testing Strategy

The development of the site involved both automated and manual testing strategies. A detailed breakdown of these testing methods is available in the [testing.md file](TESTING.md). Along with functional and code testing, User Story tests were conducted to validate that the user stories' acceptance criteria were met. The related commits for each user story can be located in the repository's issues section.

#### Testing Overview

Testing was organized into distinct sections, with individual test cases developed for each area. 

For a deeper dive into the testing methods, refer to the [TESTING.md file](TESTING.md).

#### Validator Testing

Every code file was validated using the respective validators based on their language. Full details can be found in the testing.md file. Notably, some issues emerged from third-party code:

- Django's in-built code in the settings file resulted in five line length errors.
- Bootstrap produced 260 warnings during CSS validation.
- Fontawesome CDN led to 6 HTML validation errors related to CSS variables in the CDN's CSS.

#### Automated Testing

Automated tests were diligently crafted for the Django-based blog application, ensuring its reliability. 

- **Models Testing**:
  - Recipe Model
  - Ingredient Model
  - Comment Model
  
- **Views Testing**:
  - RecipeListView
  - RecipeDetailView
  - RecipeLikeView

- **URLs Testing**: 
Proper URL resolution was ensured for each view, promoting smooth navigation.

To execute these extensive tests, clone the repository. The project's settings connect to the designated database if a database URL is available in the config variables. For safe testing, exclude the database URL in the config variables. This will prompt Django to run tests on a SQLite3 test database, which protects your primary PostgreSQL database.
